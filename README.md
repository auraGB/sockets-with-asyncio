# sockets-with-asyncio
## What It Is?
This is an example of how to use pythons built in module asyncio with TCP sockets.

### How It Works?
This code contains a client.py and server.py. The client.py is placed on a users device such as a desktop pc then the server.py is placed on a server such as a VPS with python installed, the script is always running and with asyinco this allows us to handle mutlple requests at a time from diffrent clients meaning the server can run efficeintly and not run into any issues.
